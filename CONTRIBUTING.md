## How to contribute to Shlack

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project!

#### **Did you find a bug?**
Is easy to report it! :smiley: After checking it wasn't already reported in [the issues](https://github.com/elamperti/shlack/issues), open a [new issue](https://github.com/elamperti/shlack/issues/new) with the following information:
  * What happens
  * What should happen instead
  * Steps to reproduce
  * Additional information (if any)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
That's awesome!

  * Open a new pull request with the patch
  * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution and contains a test for it if possible. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
You may submit a PR for it, though it would be nice to discuss it in an issue first, so we agree on the change to be made and how it would impact the script.

:warning: Pull requests should contain at least one test.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
Open a [new issue](https://github.com/elamperti/shlack/issues/new)!
